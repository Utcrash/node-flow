Create a react app to mimic what n8n does but using reactflow. 

1. Use reactflow to create a canvas and multiple nodes and basic functionalities.
2. Have multiple kind of nodes like 
    a. Trigger node - scheduled or manually
    b. Filter, branch, loop, if nodes
    c. Codeblock, http request nodes

3. All these nodes (on click) should open a properties page which should have a general input/output structure, just like there are for n8n nodes. 

4. Reactflow nodes, the handles in the node can be different in numbers for different kind of nodes, like "if" will have 1 target and 2 source nodes (true or false). 
5. There can be nodes like loop which might have an additional node as temp, to be replaced by another node. 

Iteration -1 


1. The handles should be on the left and right rather than top and bottom. 
2. Reducing the size of the nodes
3. See why are the icons not coming for xy-flow
4. Adding new node should be in 2 ways
 a. The current way with a panel on the left
 b. Every node should an arm with a plus icon, when clicked, a new node should be added. 

 Iteration -2 

 1. In a node like if, the + sign will overlap with the 2 source handles. 
 2. On click of plus, it should ask which node to add rather than just going for a filter node. 
 3. Reduce the size of the nodes further and rather than having the type of node and blank space in 50-50 for a node, make a 30-70 


 Iteration -3 

 1. In case there is a node like if with 2 sources, connect true to the next node when we click add. 
 2. Also, the plus icon should be outside the node. So if the node is a rectangle, there should be a line that should extend from the right and have a plus icon there. 
 
 Iteration -4 

 1. Rather than having a popover when we click on add, show the side panel with the nodes. 
 2. The base screen should have a blank node with a plus screen in the middle which will eventually be replaced by the node.
